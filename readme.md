# RelevantMusic

## A website which aims to speed up the process of choosing what music to listen to in fantasy tabletop game settings!

Choosing music for a game of D&D can be a pain. Playlists are everywhere, but I wanted to create an easy way for my friends and I to be able to select music quickly, with minimal interruption the the game. This website is intented to be that solution.

#### Goals:
 - [ ] Create v1 of the website, allowing users to choose from 5-10 different soundtracks relevant to the environment the PCs are in
 - [ ] v2: Expand environment options to include ~80% of common player environments
 - [ ] v3: Add relevant sound effects to music options, allowing DMs to elegantly control the auditory experience of the roleplaying session

 ###### Future Goals:
 * Implement for online RP websites
 * Suggestions welcome!
